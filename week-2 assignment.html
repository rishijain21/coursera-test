				<h2>Conductors</h2>
			<p> If we have used up all the electrones avaiable and a band is still only half filled, the solid is said to be good conductor. the half filled band is known as the conduction band.</p></section></div>

					<h2>Insulators</h2>
			<p>An electrical insulator is a material in which the electron does not flow freely or the atom of the insulator have tightly bound electrons whose internal electric charges do not flow freely. </p></section></div>

				<h2>Semiconductors</h2>
				<p> A semiconductor material has an electrical conductivity value falling between that of a conductor, such as metallic copper, and an insulator, such as glass. </p></section></div>
